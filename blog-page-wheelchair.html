								<h1>How to turn a Catastrophe into an Opportunity</h1>
								<div class="blog-detail">Posted <span>12 May 2022</span></div>

								<div class="blog-content">
									<p>On December 5th of 2021 I landed in the hospital for an emergency surgery on my lower back. I required a laminectomy in disks L3 and L4. A disk popped out of my spine and pushed hard into my central nerve. The continuous pressure on this nerve blocked all signals to my lower body. I ended up with both legs paralized, incapacitated and had to stay in the hospital for about 21/2 months. Doctors said the likelihood I would walk again was 40%. </p>

									<p>“It doesn’t look good” -- said the surgeon.</p>

									<p>According to all the doctors I asked, it was very likely I would end up on a wheel chair for the rest of my life. The hospital stay was difficult, but nurses and doctors were the most amazing people. They were always very positive and encouraging. A lot can be learned from health care workers.</p>

									<p>As I contemplated my situation, I decided I was not going to be defeated or depressed in the hospital. In hindsight I think I was on the first stage of grief: denial.</p>

									<p>While in the hospital I had to be laying either on a bed or a wheelchair. Standing up was out of the question: impossible. I needed assistance to put on pants, socks or go to the bathroom. Things we usually take for granted such as sitting on a toilet, or showering in privacy were out of the question. People would bring me water to my room, would help me lay on bed, would bring me food, or clothes. Everything changes when one has a handicap.</p>

									<p> People say any crisis opens a window for opportunity. How in the hell can anyone turn this hell into an opportunity?</p>

									<p> For the time being, my daily schedule at the hospital was shower at 6 am. To take a shower people needed to come over and help me into the bathroom. After a shower, they would help me get dressed and have lunch served. After lunch I would wheel myself to therapy from 8 to 2pm Monday to Fridays.</p>

									<p> My job gave me a generous medical leave. I thought for the time being I would not worry about data pipelines and ML automation. I did not feel like looking at more data science or doing work while I was handicapped, what kind of life is that?  I figured this schedule gave me a little bit of extra time to apply myself to learning something new. I had always wanted to learn how a web page is built--the right way though-- I am talking about HTML, CSS, and JS. Learning that skill takes time and it never made it  in my priority list of skills to advance my career. However, even though I noticed I did not have a will to do data science work, I noticed my true love for coding was still there. Also, I had also just bought a Macbook which I loved. I figured a productive way to use this extra time, a way to stay motivated, was to use this set back to my advantage. I decided to learn web development. </p>

									<p>I spent those two months trying to stay positive and learn as much as possible about HTML,CSS and Javascripting. I took multiple courses and spent all my spare time learning while on bed with my macbook on my lap on top of a pillow. There are alot of good learning resources out there, but people need to learn to separate the bad material from the good. </p>

									<p> Needless to say, I am now able to create cool static web pages. </p>
									<p> This personal webpage you are reading was put together by me. If it hadn’t been for this time spent at the hospital I would’ve been clueless on how to do it. I would have tried to delegate the task to some expert on the internet. I believe Web Development are the ‘a-b-c’s of technology. Every technologist with ambition to develop new products should look into it. </p>

									<p> To make a long story short, I did end up recovering my mobility completely. I took a lot of hard work and expertise from a lot of professionals. I was also able to go back to work. My surgeon was surprised when he saw me walking --and jumping-- in his office during my last visit. He has all the merit though, he performed an incredibly difficult task to extract a chunk of my spine away from my central nerve. I will be happy to give referrals to anyone who needs a great surgeon.</p>

									<p> Considering I am back at work, I am super busy again, so I can’t do Web Development learning anymore. I keep the knowledge fresh by practicing though.  Currently, I wish to learn PHP for backend development using Laravel. It looks like an amazing tool. </p>

									<p> Eventually I’ll learn PHP ! …  I keep telling myself… I just hope I don’t have to break my back again for it.  &#128516;</p>
									<p>I’d like to learn PHP because I want to build a respectable social network to connect people with a math degree who need work outside academia. This is part of a project I have with my wife. She is also a mathematician by training, a great one.. Also, I’d like to learn PHP just for the reason that I love learning new coding languages. I think it’s part of my desire to understand how the internet works.  </p>
									<p> To close these thoughts, I would like to recommend a few tools which made a difference in my learning adventure. Polyphone is an application which allows you to visualize and dynamically adjust your HTML, CSS, and JS code. Atom is a great text editor,  and finally I advise the use of the themeforest.com, which is the ebay for web developer goods. </p>
