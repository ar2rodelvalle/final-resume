											<p>There are some Frequently Asked Questions I am accumulating for future reference. This answers will be evolving as my career
												advances. I believe it is a good idea to place my answers to those questions in this space for all visitors of my webpage.</p>

											<h3>My top priorities and what I am optimizing for the next phase of my career. </h3>
											<p>
											<b>STAYING RELEVANT</b><br>
											I am looking to work with elastic and dynamic infrastructure in order to be updated in the field of Data Science (ML/AI). Some corporations utilize their on-prem tech-stack to develop their projects-- a disadvantage because this won’t allow them as fast as open source solutions or cloud based infrastructure. Working with infrastructure designed by AWS, Microsoft, GOOGLE, is future proof, and readily available.</p>
											</p>

											<p>
											<b>INCREASE MY RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE</b><br>
											Coding is an important part of my life: if learning a new coding language is part of the job, this is not a bad requirement for me. I am looking to accumulate as much knowledge as possible in coding languages and keep learning as much as possible about how the internet works.
											</p>

											<p>
											<b>BIGGER DATA</b><br>
											I want to stay in a domain where we handle Terabyte (or Petabyte) sized datasets. If it involves streaming data… even better. Big Data is a must for me. As we all know, big data means:  Volume (very important for me), Velocity (important for me), and Veracity (disparate data and obfuscation is expected).
											</p>

											<p>
											<b>PAYMENTS</b><br>
											I want to keep learning about the payments industry. I believe it’s a very powerful area to specialize in. Eventually, and ideally I would want to be involved and become an expert in the areas of digital payments  involving B2B, B2C, or P2P. It does not necessarily have to involve the exchange of money. The mere exchange of value between any two parties is an area that I find fascinating and will see a massive adoption in the future. Once the domain of micro-payments has been fully developed and prevalent, I will definitely want to be involved. At the moment I do want to keep developing the skills that will place me there. The economization of video gaming, the metaverse and similar futuristic techs will be ready soon along with its massive data needs. I am looking to prepare my ML skills to be capable of working on those domains.
											</p>

											<p>
											<b>LOGIC, MATHEMATICS, STATS and OPERATIONS RESEARCH</b><br>
											I am looking for opportunities which require use of logic and mathematics. I still intend to apply statistical concepts or optimization techniques-- areas I spent considerable time training on and I want to stay relevant.
											</p>

										<!-- </div> -->

										<h3>What are some soft skills you are proud of having acquired in the last few years?</h3>

										<p><b>DIVERSITY</b><br>
										I had the luck to find work at Fortune 500 companies. It allowed me to meet intelligent peers with different backgrounds and cultures. This has enriched my career and helped me grow as a person. I have learned lessons beyond the science and engineering domain.</p>

										<p><b>RESPECT</b><br>
										The best approach to team success has a foundation in the way every team member interacts with each other. Mutual respect, kindness and politeness is FIRST. Inclusion and tolerance are also essential qualities in any team I will work with.</p>

										<p><b>COMMUNICATION</b><br>
										As a scientist, I also happen to be an introvert. Presentations where multiple people --especially executives-- can be challenging for people with my personality traits. I have improved in this area. Furthermore, LISTENING to what people's needs is important, and I have observed how other experts practice this skill.</p>

										<p><b>DELIVERY</b><br>
										Shipping a successful product which satisfies the needs of end users is the achievement that gives me the most satisfaction, and ultimately lets me sleep at night. Delivering a successful product is what matters most to me.</p>


										<h3>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>

										<p>A first priority for me is to stay on top of the technology involved in ML/AI Operations. It's important that I keep learning portable, open source, future proof skills. Tools such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Could are good candidates to stay relevant for the future of ML/AI.</p>

										<p>At some point in the next 5 years, augmented reality will be functional and ubiquitous and thus exchange of data and value will be prevalent in the area. I would like to be involved in this domain.  Data and Payments are evolving, and I want to help create the future solutions that will enable the embedding of AI into frictionless and ubiquitous exchange of data and value.There's nothing I will rather be doing than focusing my energies into driving Data and Value exchange into a more inclusive, robust, fast and fair system for everyone. </p>

										<p>I found the most amazing roadmap which I intend to master in the coming years and I share in the image below. I need to watch out for relevant changes across time. This is a technical roadmap. I need to add business domain roadmaps and industry interests. More info soon to come. <br>
										</p>


										<!-- <h3> What have you learned from past failures? what are some of your blind spots? </h3>
										<p>We all have strengths and blind spots. <br>
											A great team leverages each individual's strengths. <br>
											I refuse to pretend I am all strengths. <br>
											I disclose some weaknesses so my team watches my back.</p>

											<p>FAILING FAST<br>
											In my line of work we perform a lot of experimentation. Not all of our projects turn out a success. If we fail only 50% of our projects we are considered to be doing very well. In the past I have failed to fail FAST, and to recognize it early. I don&rsquo;t mind failure, but I need to learn to identify when it is better to let it go and close a project as a failure. This may produce projects which can become prolonged; however my interest is to see them through and it may not be the expectations of other people in leadership. I need a spotter that lets me know when it is time to pivot. I pivot easy when suggested by peers.</p>

											<p>INFLUENCING<br>
											It&rsquo;s difficult for me to rally several people towards a cause when I have no authority over them. I notice other people are very good at telling other people what to do---even when they are not their bosses. I need to work on this skill because it can be very useful, but tricky.</p>

											<p>BEING AN EXECUTIVE<br>
											I struggle to read the whole corporation and the multiple interests involved in a project. A few of our projects can involve 4-5 teams and I don&rsquo;t always have an easy time to identify what may be each individual&rsquo;s ownership and interests. Hence it can be difficult to know what are the right things I can mention to get everyone on board. Working in a highly matrixed environment is still challenging to me. Possibly because I like to focus a lot on the technology and its possibilities.</p> -->
